    <h1>Web Assembler!</h1>
    <p>
      This document demonstrates a few of the things you can do with
      Web Assembler.  Try making some changes to the source of this document
      to get familiar with how things work.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Inserting Other Files</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most commonly used features of Web Assembler is the
      <code>&lt;w:insert&gt;</code> directive which copies the contents of a file
      into the document that the directive is found in.  This is an easy
      way to deal with a shared component (such as a navigation) so that
      it that doesn't have to be manually kept up to date in many files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of files is recursive.  If the file you're inserting
      has Web Assembler directives in it, those will be processed as well.
      The file you're inserting also inherits the runtime state of the file
      into which it's inserted&mdash;so if you were to define a property
      before inserting a file, that file would have access to the property
      as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a sentence from the file "sentence.frag.html":
      <em>
        <w:insert resource="sentence.frag.html">
          <w:define name="what" value="Jet Suit" />
        </w:insert>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration file for this site, <code>webasm.xml</code>, specifies a
      pattern in the <code>process-file-pattern</code> element.  This pattern
      matches against (canonical) paths in the source directory to determine
      which files get processed by Web Assembler.  By naming included files
      with the extension <code>.frag.html</code> (for "HTML fragment") they are
      excluded from top-level processing and are only evaluated when they are
      inserted into another file. Files with just the extension <code>.html</code>
      or <code>.js</code> <em>are</em> processed. You can, of course, use any
      pattern you like; it's just a Perl Compatible Regular Expression.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
    <p>
      Web Assembler is designed to integrate easily with other tools
      in order to expand its usefulness.  It comes bundled with the
      <a href="http://pygments.org/" target="_blank">Pygments</a>
      syntax highlighting tool which can be used to easiliy display
      more legible code and markup&mdash;just use the <code>&lt;w:highlight&gt;</code>
      directive.  Any language or format supported by Pygments is supported
      by this directive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example.  You'll notice that the C code is actually located in
      another file.  It's inserted into this document via the <code>&lt;w:insert&gt;</code>
      directive.
    </p>
    <w:highlight language="c"><w:insert resource="misc/hello.c" /></w:highlight>
    
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>
      Properties are just externalized key/value pairs that will let you define
      bits of information.  You can define a property in a configuration file
      (see <code>webasm.xml</code>), on the command line with the <code>-define</code>
      flag, or by defining environment variables in the form:
      <code>WEBASM_PROPERTY_<em>PropertyName</em>=Value</code>, where <em>PropertyName</em>
      is the name of the property you want to define and <em>Value</em> is its value.
      Below the property named "greeting" from <code>webasm.xml</code> is
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can build this project with the following command to override the configuration
      file's value:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>webasm -config webasm.xml -define greeting="Some other greeting" build</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can declare an environment variable when building:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>WEBASM_PROPERTY_greeting="Some other greeting" webasm -config webasm.xml build</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's the value of "greeting": <w:property name="greeting" />
    </p>
    
    <h2>Rendering Text</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of options out there that aim to solve the common problem of
      displaying header text set in an unusual typeface on the Web.  Not wanting to
      be left out, Web Assembler presents one more: Web Assembler can render images
      automatically from plain text so you can easily display uncommon fonts&mdash;without
      having to bother with manually creating new images in Photoshop every time you
      want to change some content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Text is rendered via Mac OS X's CoreText, the same text rendering platform that
      is used everywhere in OS X, so it looks great, and any font on your system is
      available to it.  The example below is set in Helvetica; try changing the
      <code>font-name</code> attribute to something more exotic to see how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <w:text path="images/text.png" foreground="#ff0055" font-name="Helvetica" font-size="24">CHANGE ME TO RENDER IN SOMETHING MORE FUN THAN HELVETICA!</w:text>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I really wanted to, I could even render that entire source file
      from the syntax highlighting example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <w:text path="images/source.png" width="500" height="100" background="#ffffcc" foreground="#000000" font-name="TradeGothic-BoldOblique" font-size="12"><w:insert resource="misc/hello.c" /></w:text>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Integrating Scripts &amp; Other Applications</h2>
    <p>
      Web Assembler is designed to work with scripts and other applications.  You
      can integrate pretty much any kind of content processing or generation by
      using the <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> directive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> directive works like this:
      <ol>
        <li>The content in the <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> tag is first processed by Web Assembler</li>
        <li>The command specified in the <code>command</code> attribute is executed and the (already processed) content of the <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> tag is written to its standard input</li>
        <li>If the command writes anything to its standard output, that content replaces the <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> tag in the output document</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way you can easily write filter scripts that perform some
      processing on content in a file.  Or, you could write a script that
      generates other files and saves them (say, some images) and then
      writes the &lt;img&gt; tags back into the output document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a (pointless) example that duplicates every word found in
      the content of the <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> directive some number of times.
      Take a look at the script <code>scripts/duplicate.pl</code> to see how it
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        <w:execute command="../scripts/duplicate.pl" times="3">
          I don't mean to be redundant, but sometimes I can't help myself.
        </w:execute>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, I could do something equally trivial using another program, like display
      all the files in the examples directory:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><w:execute command="/bin/ls" arg="-l" arg="." /></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      See the Web Assembler manpage for details on environment variables available
      to scripts executed by <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Formatting Text with Markdown</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a good format for computers to interpret formatted text,
      but it's a cumbersome format for people to write text.  Web Assembler
      comes bundled with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber's</a>
      <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
      text formatter so you can work with your content in a more manageable
      format, then convert it automatically to HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;w:markdown&gt;</code> tag, like the <code>&lt;w:highlight&gt;</code>
      tag, uses the same <code>&lt;w:execute&gt;</code> tag approach as above (with a custom tag
      name configured in the default Web Assembler configuration file).  You can do the same
      thing with your own commonly-used scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's some Markdown:
    </p>
    <w:markdown>
This is a Markdown Header
-------------------------

* These are Markdown bullet points.
* We'll make a few just to illustrate the idea.
* Alright, duly illustrated.
    </w:markdown>
    
    <h2>Using JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      Web Assembler supports embedding scripting with JavaScript.  You
      can use JS expressions to create conditional output or display the
      result of expressions with <code>&lt;w:print&gt;</code>.  Like properties,
      JavaScript state is inherited by inserted files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's some examples:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's the output of our <code>getTheDate()</code> JS function which
      is defined at the top of the file: <w:print value="getTheDate()" />
    </p>
    <p>
      What file are we in? <w:print value="document.getSourcePath()" />
    </p>
    <p>
      What file will the output be in? <w:print value="document.getDestinationPath()" />
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that <em>greeting</em> property again? "<w:print value="directive.getProperty('greeting')" />"
    </p>
    <p>
      Are we in a file that ends in ".html"?
      <w:if test="document.getSourcePath().lastIndexOf('.html') == document.getSourcePath().length - 5">
        Yes, we are.
      </w:if>
      <w:else>
        No, we're not.
      </w:else>
    </p>
