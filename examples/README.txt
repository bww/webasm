WEB ASSEMBLER EXAMPLES

Take a look at the source HTML in the "source" directory to see
how Web Assembler directives are used.  Then build the example
project from this directory like so:

  $ webasm -config webasm.xml build
  
Then you can take a look at the output in the "web" directory
to see what Web Assembler generates.  You can use this example
project as a starting point for your own project until you're
more familiar with how things are organized.

You can read the reference documentation manpage with the command:

  $ man webasm
